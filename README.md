Visualization and analysis of Chicago bike lanes. An effort to determine how the bike lane installations are divided among the entire city.

Peace Everyone,

This is Oboi Reed, emailing from our Slow Roll Chicago email account in order to also post this email on the ChiHackNight Google Group. 

The Transit Group of Open Gov Hack Night dedicated last Tue night's meeting to framing up our bicycle equity data project. We had a great meeting and we did a great job developing a clean, simple framework for our work. This framework will guide us in both the short term and long term process of developing, organizing, and presenting the results of this data project. 

Below are some notes from the meeting. Reach out with any questions or suggestions. For the folks I've added recently to this email distro list, feel free to contact me and I can catch you up on our progress. 

Here you go, let's ride...

​### Problem

Bicycle infrastructure is inequitably distributed in Chicago. And, as a result, Black, Brown, and LMI communities/residents are cut-off from all the various, inherent benefits from the activity of cycling.

### Thesis

Our goal is equal bicycle usage across neighborhoods in Chicago. In other words, through the use of data, we are working to achieve the same number of people in Englewood​ riding a bike as the number in Wicker Park​. We believe we get there by investing comparatively more in bike infrastructure​ installations​, ​​encouragement​/education programs​,​ and telling a comprehensive bikeability/liveability ​story​ to elected officials, community leaders, & residents - all in Black, Brown, & LMI neighborhoods across the City, than what is invested in predominantly white or middle- to upper-income communities. Slow Roll Chicago will take the lead on ​encouragement​/education programs​ and telling a comprehensive ​story about the value of strong bike communities. The Transit Group of Open Gov Hack Night will take the lead on using data to make a rational yet compelling case to the City and State that bicycle infrastructure in Chicago is inequitably distributed and call for higher levels of infrastructure investment in underserved communities. 

​### Use of ​Data
 
​_W​e ​currently ​have​ this data​:_
* bike mode share
* bike routes
* race, ethnicity, population
* ward boundaries
* Divvy​ stations​
​
_We currently need this data:_
* income ​(Steve​)​
* land use ​(​Eric​)​
* transit accessibility index (TAI) from CMAP​ (Oboi & Martin​ Menninger)​

### Goal​s​

* Create a layered map to show the reality​ of bike infrastructure distribution in Chicago. Use ​these visuals to determine next steps. Before​ we publish the data, we will involve a ​few more groups to get feedback. Example: Transitized How Chicago Commutes map. 
* Create an equity index. 
* Integrate​ the data and visuals on the Slow Roll Chicago website
​* Analyze the data and produce a report for each ​Chicago ​ward​, determining "here’s where you’re at, here’s what you need to do​".
​* Create a presentation​, perhaps for the March Mayor's Bicycle Advisory Council.
* Model​ the potential benefits ​of biking ​at the hyperlocal local​ level. Answer the question, "if this many more people started biking here​ are the results, such as new retail businesses​, violence prevention, economic development, healthier lifestyles, job​ creation, and higher property values".​​​

### Attract ​People
* CNT:​ ???​
* CMAP: Martin Menninger, Noel Paterson, Tom Murtha, John Oneal
* A​ctive ​T​ransportation ​A​lliance​: ​???​
* Chicago Cycling Club​: ???​
* Chicago Black Bike Coalition​: Slow Roll Chicago, Major Taylor​ ​Cycling​ Club of Chicago​ & Friends of ​the ​Major Taylor Trail
* SRAM​: Randy Neufeld​
* Neighborhood Associations & Community Organizations
​* Supportive Aldermen​
​​
### Community Barriers​ to Address​

* Focus needs to be on violence prevention
* More jobs is a more important issue
* Less parking is an inconvenience
* Gentrification is coming
* Perception of biking (white, children, spandex​ wearers​, poor​ people​) 
​
For the folks who were at the meeting, please let me know in case I missed anything in notes above or you notice any errors in the notes. 

At next week's meeting, plan is to have all the remaining data we need and begin working on the layered map visuals. 

I'm scheduled to present at Open Gov Hack Night on Jan 27th. And, will share our early drafts of the map. 

Thanks much y'all, be well and see you all on next Tue...

Warmly,

Oboi
